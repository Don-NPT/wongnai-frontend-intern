# From Napat Sutthiwong

### This project is my frontend assignment from LINE MAN Wongnai.
In order to run this project, you need to run 3 things: json-server, api-gateway server (nodejs), and React app.

The modules needed is already include in the package's dependencies,
but for convenience, I'll put them here as well.

json-server
> npm install json-server

api-gateway server
> npm install express cors node-fetch

React app
> npm install axios react react-dom react-scripts

All of them can be run by "npm start"

### Heres are the snapshots of the website:

This is the initial appearance of the webpage.
