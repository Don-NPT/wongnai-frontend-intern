From Napat Sutthiwong

This project is for Wongnai frontend assignment for interns
In order to run this project, you need to run 3 things: json-server, api-gateway server (nodejs), and React app

The modules needed is already include in the package's dependencies
but for convenience, I'll put them here as well.

json-server
> npm install json-server

api-gateway server
> npm install express cors node-fetch

React app
> npm install axios react react-dom react-router-dom react-script react-scripts web-vitals

All of them can be run by "npm start"

Heres are the snapshots of the website:
